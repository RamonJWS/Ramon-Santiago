## Project Motivation

The purpose of this project is to try and determine if users leaving reviews of restaurants have a positive or negative outlook. This is easily done on Yelp as the user will leave a rating out of 5. However, review on other social media platforms might not have this rating. This project looks at predicting if reviews have a positive or negative outlook without a rating.
